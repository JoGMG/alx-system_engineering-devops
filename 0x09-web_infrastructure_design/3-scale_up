Q1: For every additional element, why you are adding it
Ans: 1 web server, 1 application server and 1 database all with their own server to scale up and allow for more capacity to handle more traffic and functionalities. 1 load balancer to serve as a fall back so that if one of the load balancers fails the other one takes over.
